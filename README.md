# week 2 challenge: main-portfolio-site
Create a portfolio website to hold all future websites for future employers to view.
https://sdoval27.github.io/sasha-portfolio/

## Description

- This portfolio site has been create to demonstrate knowledge of advanced CSS tools such as hover, media query, and flexible design for a better user experience.

### Navigation Links:
The links in the top right corner of the navigation (excluding the #resume) direct users to the corresponding section of the page. There are also external links in the 'contact me' section that lead to my github and linkedin profiles.

### Images:
- I have included a recent Bio image of myself, as well as placeholder images for future projects. If a user hovers over these placeholder images, the images grow bigger. The placeholder images also have a link that direct the user to an external page with only that image.

### Media Queries:
- when the viewport becomes smaller, the sidebar has been programmed to disappear, and the two columns of images become one column.
